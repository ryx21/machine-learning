# Machine-Learning

*What I cannot create, I do not understand - Richard Feynman*

A repository for me to play around with implementing ML algorithms, and practice my software engineering skills.

### Project Setup
Create a virtual environment:
```
conda create -n <env> python=3.8
conda activate <env>
```

Install the package locally in editable mode:
```
pip install -e .
```
